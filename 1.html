  <p>It has been a while since I wrote to you the last time.</p>
  <p style='margin-top:10px;'>I heard that epidemics break through again in European area and some countries declared national lockdown.</p>
  It is impossible to restore the condition before the outbreak of COVID-19, But I hope everything goes well!<br>There are several news. First, I left my job and I prepare the new job education - programming.
  Other says that it is late to <strong>change <u>my career</u></strong>, but for me it is the best chance to challenge my limits.
  Someday I expect to live abroad with my wife as a programmer.<br><img src="images/coding.jfif" width="40%"><br>Second, I have been to Jangduk-li last week and spent the nice time with Harmony.

  Additionally, Lisa said hello to you.
  <br>Sincerely,
  <br>From Sasha and Lisa.
